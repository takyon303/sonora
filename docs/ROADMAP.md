# Roadmap

Each phase ends with something a person can actually use. A phase is only done
when its acceptance criteria pass.

Product requirements collected for later phases (Soulseek identity modes,
sharing, keyless metadata and artwork, queue rules, format preference, cache
eviction, device sync, folder layout, onboarding) live in
[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md). That document is the source of truth for
what each phase has to cover.

## Phase 1 — Foundation ✅

Delivered:

- Cargo workspace with one-way crate dependencies.
- SQLite schema, migrations, repositories, FTS5 search.
- Recursive incremental scanner with tag extraction and file-name fallback.
- Slint shell: sidebar navigation, Home, Tracks, Albums, Library folders,
  global search, live scan status.
- CLI: `--scan`, `--where`, `--version`.
- Unit and integration tests for parsing, database behaviour and scanning.

Acceptance: scanning a folder twice imports then reports everything unchanged;
deleting a file removes it from the library on the next scan. ✅

## Phase 2 — Playback and library

- `sonora-playback`: GStreamer engine (`playbin3`, explicit queue, gapless via
  `about-to-finish`), seek/volume, device selection, ReplayGain from tags,
  persisted queue.
- Apple-Music-style queue rules (shuffle only upcoming, play next, add to queue,
  drag reorder, repeat off/all/one) — logic and tests already landed in
  `sonora-core::queue`; this phase drives it from the engine and the queue panel.
- Settings document persisted in SQLite: format preference and bitrate ceiling,
  cache budget and folder, download folder, folder template, artwork
  format/quality, sync opt-in and onboarding flag, inspectable with
  `sonora --settings`.
- Play counts, ratings, favourites, skip tracking, history.
- Album and artist detail views, artwork placeholders, queue panel.
- Custom playlists and smart playlists with a rule editor.
- MPRIS (Linux) and SMTC (Windows) media controls; Android uses its platform
  media session instead (see the Android track).

Acceptance: playback survives restart with its queue; play counts and history
are written per track; a smart playlist updates live as rules change.

## Phase 3 — Artwork

- Embedded artwork extraction, content-addressed cache and renditions.
- Batch PNG/WebP → JPEG with configurable quality, max dimension, alpha
  flattening; resumable and idempotent.
- Candidate review UI; nothing is replaced without explicit approval.
- Embedded artwork writing, external `cover.jpg` export, Rockbox layout.

Acceptance: a 2 000-album library converts without corrupting any tag, and the
review screen shows every proposed change before it is applied.

## Phase 4 — Online

- Keyless metadata and artwork first: MusicBrainz, Cover Art Archive, Deezer and
  iTunes for profiles, artist pictures and covers, cached on disk.
- Last.fm (needs a free developer API key): auth, scrobbling with an offline
  queue, now-playing, loved tracks, charts, similar artists, recommendations,
  cached responses.
- Lyrics: LRCLIB + local `.lrc`, synced highlighting, editing, caching.
- Discord Rich Presence (hidden while paused, fully disableable): RPC/IPC on
  desktop, and on Android through the Discord Social SDK, which publishes
  presence without account linking when the Discord app is installed and signed
  in (SDK 1.10+, Android 7.0+).
- Discovery homepage that degrades to local data when offline.

Acceptance: an offline session's scrobbles replay correctly on reconnect; the
homepage renders with the network unplugged.

## Phase 5 — Devices (Windows and Linux)

- Volume detection: Linux (mount table + udev) and Windows (SetupAPI). Android
  has no device sync at all; see the Android track.
- Sync profiles, diff planning against a device manifest, resumable copies with
  progress, free-space checks, safe unplug handling.
- Rockbox-compatible artwork export. The Y1 is treated as plain USB mass
  storage; Rockbox is an option, never an assumption.

Acceptance: unplugging mid-transfer and re-plugging resumes without duplicates.

## Phase 6 — Downloads

- Spike: `soulseek-rs-lib` versus an external `slskd` daemon, judged on licence,
  stability and packaging cost. Backend hidden behind a trait either way.
- Identity modes: sign in with a real account, or opt into a rotated random
  identity with its rate-limit and ToS caveats surfaced in the UI.
- Sharing gate: shared-folder uploads, or a clear explanation when a peer
  refuses downloads from non-sharing users.
- Search with filters, transfer queue, history, import with metadata and art
  into the user's chosen download folder, laid out by the folder template.
- Legal acknowledgement before first use.

## Android track (parallel from phase 2)

Android is a first-class target, so its work runs alongside the desktop phases
instead of after them.

- NDK build harness (`cargo-apk` or a Gradle + `cargo-ndk` project) producing an
  APK that links the Slint Android backend and a GStreamer Android build of the
  same plugin set, for arm64-v8a plus an emulator ABI.
- Responsive, touch-first layout: bottom navigation, single-column lists, a
  queue sheet, larger hit targets, no hover-only actions.
- Library access through the Storage Access Framework, with the same incremental
  scan and FTS search as desktop.
- Playback in a foreground service with a media notification and lock-screen
  controls, surviving backgrounding and screen-off.
- Downloads and cache inside app-scoped storage, with an optional user-granted
  folder; no external device sync (a phone is a playback client, never a sync
  host).
- Discord Rich Presence through the Discord Social SDK, published without account
  linking when the Discord app is installed; system media controls through
  `MediaSession` and the media notification.

Acceptance: on a physical Android device, pick a folder in the system picker,
scan it, play a track gaplessly with the screen off, and get the same queue back
after the app is killed and reopened.

## Phase 7 — Polish

- First-run onboarding (folders, format preference, Last.fm, sharing notice,
  device setup) plus a "run onboarding again" button in settings.
- Packaging: Windows installer, Linux AppImage/Flatpak, signed Android APK/AAB.
- Keyboard shortcuts, accessibility pass, error reporting, performance work.
- Format coverage validation against a real test corpus.
