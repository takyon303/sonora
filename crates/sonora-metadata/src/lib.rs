//! Keyless metadata services.
//!
//! Sonora's library works without an account and without an API key, so the
//! default providers are the ones that accept anonymous requests:
//!
//! * **MusicBrainz** for release identity (which then points at Cover Art Archive)
//! * **Cover Art Archive** for release covers
//! * **Deezer** and **iTunes** as keyless artwork fallbacks
//! * **LRCLIB** for synced and plain lyrics
//!
//! Last.fm is the one service that needs a key, and it is purely additive: it
//! supplies listener tags on top of the keyless data, and everything still works
//! when no key is configured.
//!
//! Every provider is reached through the [`Http`] trait so the parsing and the
//! fallback order can be tested against canned responses instead of the network.
